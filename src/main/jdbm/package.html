    <p>JDBM is simple embedded Key Value database.</p>
	
	<h1>JDBM where it fits</h1>
	Key-Value databases good attention recently, but their history is much older. GDBM on which JDBM is based on started 
	in 1970 and is called 'pre rational' database. JDBM is under development since 2000. Version 1.0 was in production 
	since 2005 with little bug reported. JDBM2 adds some features on top of JDBM (most importantly <code>java.util.Map</code> views)
	<p/>
	JDBM2 goal is to provide simple and fast persistence. It is very simple to use, have minimal overhead and standalone 
	JAR have only 130KB. It is excelent choice for Swing application or Android phone. JDBM also handles huge datasets well
	and can be used for data processing (author is using it to process astronomical data). 
	Source code is without magic and simple, so it is well readabable and can be used for teaching<<>>.
	On other side it does not have some important features (concurrent scalability, multiple transaction, annotations...),
	it is tax to pay to keep it simple. JDBM goal is not to replicate Valdemort, HBase or other
	Key Value database. 
	<p/>
	<h2>JDBM2 is not</h2>
	
	<h3>SQL database</h3>
	JDBM2 is more low level. With this comes great power (speed, resource usage, no ORM) 
	but also big responsibility. You are responsible for data integrity, partioning, typing etc... 
	Excelent embedded SQL database is <<H2>> (in fact it is faster then JDBM2 in many cases). 
	
	<h3>Object database</h3>
	The fact JDBM2 uses serialization may give you false sense of security. It does not 
	magically split huge object graph into smaller pieces, nor handle duplicates. 
	You may easily end up with single instance being persisted in several copyes in datastore.
	But object database does this magic for you, it traverses object graph references and 
	makes sure there are no duplicates in datastore. Have look at <<NeoDatis>> or <<DB4o>>
	
	<h3>Enterprise level</h3>
	JDBM2 codebase is propably very good and without bugs, but it is community project. You may were easily endup without 
	support. For something more enterprisey have look at <<Berkley DB Java Edition>> from Oracle. BDB have more  
	features, is more robust, have better documentation, bigger overhead and comes with pricetag.
	
	<h3>Distributed</h3>
	Key Values databases are associated with distributed stores. JDBM is not distributed, it runs on single computer only. 
	You are propably looking for <<Valdemort>>
	
	<h2>JDBM2 features</h2>
	JDBM2 have some helpfull features to make it easyer to use. It also brings it closer to SQL and helps with data 
	integrity checks and data queryes. 
	<h3>Low level page store</h3>
	
	
	
	
	
    
    <h1>10 things to keep on mind</h1>
	<ul> 
	<li>Uncommited data are stored in memory, if you get <code>OutOfMemoryException</code> make commits more
		often.
	<li>Keys and values are stored as part of index nodes. They are instanciated each time index is searched.
		If you have larger value (>512 bytes), this may hurt performance and cause <code>OutOfMemoryException</code>
		In this case use <<StoreReference>> or <<StorageMap>> to store values outside of index.
	<li>If you run into performance problems, use profiler rather then ask on internet.	
	<li>JDBM caches returned object instances. If you modify an object (like set new name on person),
		next time RecordManager may return object with this modification. 
	<li>Iteration over Maps is not guaranteed if there are structural changes 
		(for example adding new entry while iterating). There is no <<fail fast policy>> yet. 
		So all iterations over Maps should be synchronized on RecordManager.
	<li>More memory means more performance, use <code>-Xmx000m</code> generously. JDBM have good SoftReference cache.
	<li>It is safe not to close db before exiting, but there will be cleanup on next start.
	</ul>
	

    <p>

    <p>You can use it to store a mix of hashtables and blobs, and all updates are 
       done in a transactionally safe manner.</p>
